# AWS Transit Gateway Connect Sample

## Welcome

This repository demonstrates the usage of Transit Gateway (TGW) connect and accelerates your integration of SDWAN appliances with AWS Transit Gateway.

For more details, checkout the [Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html) and our [Blog Article](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/simplify-sd-wan-connectivity-with-aws-transit-gateway-connect/).

## Pre-requisites

Example ip ranges see architecture diagram and pre-requisites folder in this repository

* Pick a region from the [Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html#tgw-connect-requirements)
* Transit Gateway setup with unused CIDR attached
* VPC with two public subnets
* VPC attached to Transit Gateway
* Public subnets route table entries with destination TGW CIDR pointing to TGW

## Deployment
1. (Optional) Deploy [tgw_vpc_basics.yaml](./pre-requisites/tgw_vpc_basics.yaml) for VPC and Transit Gateway setup
2. Important: Manually attach a CIDR block to Transit Gateway (here: `10.10.0.0/24`)
3. Deploy [gre_setup.yaml](gre_setup.yaml), important parameters are the transport TGW attachment id, route table id and VPC information

## Deployment Consumer VPCs
1. VPC needs to be attached to TGW
2. Consumer subnets need a default route (`0.0.0.0/0`) towards TGW
3. VPC attachment has to be associated with GRE main route table
4. Routing from TGW towards consumer VPC has to be in place within GRE main route table 

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](docs/tgw-connect.png)

## Data Points
* Dual redundant setup, two SDWAN instances with two GRE tunnels each
* Full appliance instance failover takes `~30s`

## Limitations
* Not all regions support TGW Connect (details see AWS documentation: [TGW Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-connect.html))
* CFN resource type `AWS::EC2::TransitGatewayConnect` is not supported in all regions

### Note:

* **While code samples in this repository has been tested and believe it works well, as always, be sure to test it in your environment before using it in production!**
* **The sample SDWAN appliances are just break-outs to the public internet in this sample setup**

## How to debug BGP sessions on SDWAN appliances

1. Login to the EC2 instances via Session Manager
2. Display actually applied routes to the kernel's table - `ip route`
3. Open vty shell tool - `sudo vtysh`
4. Display BGP session status - `show ip bgp summary`
5. Display routes being advertised and applied to kernel route table - `show ip route`
